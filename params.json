To use the API you must have a developer authentication token. During the pre-release period, please contact cpetersen@assaydepot.com to obtain a token.\r\n\r\n## Location\r\nThe API is accessible at `/api` on whatever website you use. For instance, public marketplace customers (users of http://www.assaydepot.com) can access the api at:\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.assaydepot.com/api\r\n```\r\nVendors can access the api at:\r\n```\r\nhttps://backoffice.assaydepot.com/api\r\n```\r\nAnd private RX customers can access the api using their custom url:\r\n```\r\nhttps://[custom].assaydepot.com/api\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\nThe API requires the user to authenticate. For convenience you may authenticate using a token associated with your account. During the pre-release period, please contact cpetersen@assaydepot.com to obtain a token.\r\n\r\nYou can specify the authentication token on the query string using the `auth_token` query parameter. For instance:\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.assaydepot.com/api?auth_token=1234567890\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe authentication token is only strictly required for the first request of the session, but you may include it with every request.\r\n\r\n## Vendors\r\n"}
