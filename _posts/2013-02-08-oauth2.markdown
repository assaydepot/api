# OAuth 2.0 Authentication

To access Assay Depot's JSON API, you must first authenticate your
application via the OAuth2 protocol. We currently support two
authorization grant types: <a href="#authcode">Authorization Code</a>
and <a href="#clientcred">Client Credentials</a>.

This page is not intended to be in-depth documentation for the OAuth
2.0 Framework. For detailed information about OAuth 2.0, you can check
out these resources:

* [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
* [OAuth 2.0 Authorization of client applications.](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/oauth2/authorization.html)

<h2 id="authcode">Authorization Code</h2>

Use the Authorizaton Code grant type for an application that requires
the user to log in, most commonly to access resources that are
specific to that user on the server. Examples: user profile details or
access to a user's communication history.

<h2 id="clientcred">Client Credentials</h2>

Use the Client Credentials grant type for an application that requires
access to resources that do not have a resource owner on the
server. Examples: a search by keywords or accessing a specific ware.
