# JSON API Documentation
Scientist's (formerly Assay Depot) JSON API gives read-only access to vendors and services. To use the API you must [authenticate using OAuth2](/api/oauth2).

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
The API is accessible at `/api` on whatever website you use. For instance, public marketplace customers (users of [http://app.scientist.com](http://app.scientist.com)) can access the api at:

{% highlight bash %}
https://app.scientist.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

Vendors can access the api at:

{% highlight bash %}
https://backoffice.scientist.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

And private RX customers can access the api using their custom URL:

{% highlight bash %}
https://[custom].scientist.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
The API requires the user to authenticate. To use the API you must [authenticate using OAuth2](/api/oauth2). Scientist supports both Authorization Code and Client Credential workflows.

You should specify the authentication token using the `Authorization` header. For instance:

{% highlight bash %}
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer 123456" https://app.scientist.com/api/[resource].json
{% endhighlight %}

or in Ruby
{% highlight ruby %}
RestClient.get("https://app.scientist.com/api/[resource].json", "Authorization" => "Bearer 123456")
{% endhighlight %}

The authentication token is only strictly required for the first request of the session, but you may include it with every request. All examples assume the user has successfully authenticated.

<h2 id="vendors">Vendors</h2>
There are two functions you can perform on vendors, search and get.

<h3 id="vendor-search">Vendor Search Query</h3>
Search queries take the form:

{% highlight bash %}
https://app.scientist.com/api/providers.json?q=[query term(s)]
{% endhighlight %}

For example, to search for vendors that match the term "antibody", you would use the url:

{% highlight bash %}
https://app.scientist.com/api/providers.json?q=antibody
{% endhighlight %}

The system will search for the word antibody or it's synonyms in all applicable vendor fields.


<h3 id="vendor-search-options">Vendor Search Query Options</h3>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>page</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>When there are more results than can fit on a single page, you can retrieve different pages by changing this parameter.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td>per_page</td>
      <td>25</td>
      <td>You can change the number of results returned per request by changing this parameter.</td>
    </tr><tr>

      <td>You can refine the result set by specifying facet values. See the <a href="#vendor-search-facets">vendor search facets section</a> for more information.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="vendor-search-facets">Vendor Search Facets</h3>
Vendor search results can be refined using facets. To apply a facet to a search use a URL in the following format:

{% highlight bash %}
https://app.scientist.com/api/providers.json?facets[facet_name][]=facet_value
{% endhighlight %}

For instance, if you wanted find vendors that are members of BIOCOM, you would use the following URL:

{% highlight bash %}
https://app.scientist.com/api/providers.json?facets[professional_associations][]=BIOCOM
{% endhighlight %}

You may specify multiple facets in a single query. It's important to note, unlike the query string, facet values must match exactly.

<h3 id="vendor-search-facets">Vendor Search Facets Values</h3>
There are numerous facets that can be specified. Below is a table of a few interesting facets. Search results contain lists of all the applicable facet names and values, you should consult these results for a more complete list.

      <td>professional_associations</td>
