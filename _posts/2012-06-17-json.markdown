title: Assay Depot's JSON API

# Welcome to Assay Depot's JSON API Documentation
Assay Depot's JSON API gives read-only access to vendors and services. To use the API you must have a developer authentication token. During the pre-release period, please contact cpetersen@assaydepot.com to obtain a token.

## Location
The API is accessible at `/api` on whatever website you use. For instance, public marketplace customers (users of http://www.assaydepot.com) can access the api at:
{% highlight %}
https://www.assaydepot.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

Vendors can access the api at:
{% highlight %}
https://backoffice.assaydepot.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

And private RX customers can access the api using their custom url:
{% highlight %}
https://[custom].assaydepot.com/api
{% endhighlight %}

## Authentication
The API requires the user to authenticate. For convenience you may authenticate using a token associated with your account. During the pre-release period, please contact cpetersen@assaydepot.com to obtain a token.

You can specify the authentication token on the query string using the `auth_token` query parameter. For instance:
{% highlight %}
https://www.assaydepot.com/api?auth_token=1234567890
{% endhighlight %}

The authentication token is only strictly required for the first request of the session, but you may include it with every request. All examples assume the user has successfully authenticated.

## Vendors
There are two functions you can perform on vendors, search and get. 

### Vendor Search Query
Search queries take the form:
{% highlight %}
https://www.assaydepot.com/api/providers.json?q=assay
{% endhighlight %}

### Vendor Search Return Value
This will return
